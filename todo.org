** Building
So, whenever we push to "submission" branch (or a branch called
"submission/foo"), orgs will:

- Clone our repo (branch submission).
- Copy Dockerfile from their repo <-- THIS IS IMPORTANT, so we
  effectively cant change the dockerfile

- Run "docker build", which will effectively run build.sh, BUT WITHOUT
  NETWORK, so we can't add/install packages on the fly

- Run the image, which will run `run.sh`
